# LinkedIn to Twitter Automation Script

This script automates the process of posting your LinkedIn articles to Twitter. It checks your LinkedIn profile for new articles and posts any that have not already been tweeted.

## Features
- Scrapes LinkedIn articles from your LinkedIn author page.
- Fetches recent tweets from your Twitter profile to check if articles have been posted.
- Posts any missing LinkedIn articles to Twitter.
- Keeps track of posted articles to avoid duplicate tweets.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Twitter Developer Account with API v2 access
- LinkedIn author page URL

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andersonkevin/linkedintoxpublisher.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```env
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
TWITTER_USER_ID=your_user_id_here
```

Replace `your_bearer_token_here` and `your_user_id_here` with your actual Twitter API Bearer Token and Twitter User ID.

### 5. Run the Script
```bash
python linkedintox2.py
```

## Usage

- The script will scrape your LinkedIn author page for articles.
- It will then check your recent tweets to see if the articles have already been posted.
- Any articles not yet tweeted will be posted to your Twitter account.
- The script maintains a list of posted articles to prevent duplicates.

## Customization

- **LinkedIn URL**: Update the `linkedin_url` variable in the `main()` function with your specific LinkedIn author page URL.
- **Environment Variables**: The script relies on environment variables for security. Ensure these are set correctly in the `.env` file.
